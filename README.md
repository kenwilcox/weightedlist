# Weighted List

This project is just a sampling of how to solve a problem.

## The Problem
- I had a list of things to choose from.
- I had several people with opinions of what items to choose
- I wanted to have them vote, and see what is similar between them

## The Solution
The solution is what I called a weighted list. It might have some other name, but I'm tired and naming things is hard.

This was done as a simple C# application, and I decided to try and see how well AI was in writing the solution in different languages. Any other language in this project was written by AI.

## The Realization
It was a fun experiment

# Example
I created two examples. One for dinner ideas, the other for trips. There is a script in the example folder that can help generate random data.

## Sample Output
The following is output based on the example data at the time of writing this README. I don't plan on keeping this up to date if it changes.

### Dinner

```
4 - parmesan tilapia (jenny, john, mike, sue)
3 - shrimp scampi (jenny, john, mike)
2 - beef-stuffed zucchini (john, sue)
2 - chicken fajitas (mike, sue)
2 - dijon-crusted fish (john, sue)
2 - shepherds pie (jenny, mike)
2 - smothered chicken breasts (jenny, mike)
1 - baked tilapia (sue)
1 - chicken and dumplings (john)
1 - huli huli chicken (jenny)
```

### Trips

```
4 - swiss alps (jenny, john, mike, sue)
3 - bora bora (john, mike, sue)
3 - greece (jenny, john, sue)
2 - japan (jenny, mike)
2 - machu picchu (mike, sue)
2 - northern lights (john, sue)
1 - iceland (john)
1 - maldives (jenny)
1 - northern california wine country (mike)
1 - rome (jenny)
```

# Finished?
I don't know if this project is finished. I don't need to, or plan on making changes to it. I may add additional languages just because I'm curious as to how to do it in other languages, and to see how well AI is in doing the conversions.

This should not be used as a best practice as how things should be done. That was not the intent.

I'm not sure if I want to accept any pull requests, but I'm open to any discussion.

This was an itch that was scratched.
