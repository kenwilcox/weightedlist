# JavaScript

JavaScript at this point should be a misnomer. Yes, it's a language, but it depends on the context it's being used.

This has three flavors of JavaScript. Node, Deno, and Bun.

```shell
$ bun --version
1.3.0

$ deno --version
deno 2.5.4 (stable, release, x86_64-apple-darwin)
v8 14.0.365.5-rusty
typescript 5.9.2

$ node --version
v23.8.0

```
