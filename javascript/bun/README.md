# Usage

Do something like the following to run the examples on your system

Assumes you already have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed on your system. No dependencies.

```zsh
$ bun run ./index.js ../../example/dinner
```

or

```zsh
$ bun run ./index.js ../../example/trips
```

That's it â€” no build step required.
