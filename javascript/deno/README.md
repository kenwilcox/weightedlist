# Usage

Do something like the following to run the examples on your system

Assumes you already have [Deno](https://deno.com) installed on your system. No external dependencies. You need read permission to access the input files.

```zsh
$ deno run --allow-read ./index.js ../../example/dinner
```

or

```zsh
$ deno run --allow-read ./index.js ../../example/trips
```

That's it â€” no build step required.
